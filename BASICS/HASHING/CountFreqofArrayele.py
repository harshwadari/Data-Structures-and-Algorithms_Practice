"""
Given an array nums of size n which may contain duplicate elements.
Rreturn a list of pairs where each pair contains a unique element 
from the array and its frequency in the array.
You may return the result in any order, but each element must appear exactly once in the output.

Example 1

Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 1, 3]

Output: [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 1]]

Explanation:

- 1 appears 2 times

- 2 appears 2 times

- 3 appears 1 time

Order of output can vary.
