# Mother Vertex
"""
Given a directed graph with V vertices labeled from 0 to V-1 and a list of edges 
edges[][], where each edge is represented as [u, v] indicating a directed edge 
from vertex u to vertex v, find a Mother Vertex of the graph.

A Mother Vertex is a vertex from which all other vertices can be reached.

If multiple such vertices exist, return the one with the smallest value.
If no such vertex exists, return -1.
Examples:

Input: V = 5, edges[][] = [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Vertices 0, 1, and 2 can each reach all other vertices in the graph.
 Among them, 0 is the smallest, so the output is 0.
  
Input: V = 3, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [2, 1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No vertex can reach all other vertices in the graph. Hence, there is 
no Mother Vertex, and the output is -1.
 
Constraints:
1 ≤ V ≤ 105
1 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] ≤ V-1
